AI FREELANCE PROJECT – END-TO-END CHECKLIST
(Project example: Defect detection from 2,000 product images)

========================================
0. FREELANCE SETUP (ONCE PER CLIENT)
[ ] Client contact + NDA signed (if needed)
[ ] Scope defined (what is included / excluded)
[ ] Success metric agreed (e.g. F1 ≥ 0.90, latency < 200 ms)
[ ] Delivery format agreed (API / script / UI)
[ ] Price + payment terms agreed
[ ] Access to data granted

========================================
1. PROBLEM DEFINITION
[ ] Define task type (classification / detection / segmentation)
[ ] Define inputs (image type, resolution, format)
[ ] Define outputs (labels, bounding boxes, confidence)
[ ] Define constraints (latency, hardware, cloud/on-prem)
[ ] Define evaluation metrics

========================================
2. DATA AUDIT
[ ] Count samples per class
[ ] Check label quality
[ ] Identify class imbalance
[ ] Identify edge cases (lighting, occlusion, blur)
[ ] Split train / val / test
[ ] Decide on data augmentation
[ ] Decide Go / No-Go feasibility

========================================
3. BASELINE MODEL (FAST)
[ ] Choose baseline architecture
[ ] Train baseline model
[ ] Log metrics
[ ] Run inference on validation set
[ ] Perform error analysis
[ ] Identify biggest failure modes

========================================
4. ITERATION & IMPROVEMENT
[ ] Improve data (cleaning / relabeling)
[ ] Tune hyperparameters
[ ] Try alternative architectures if needed
[ ] Re-evaluate metrics
[ ] Confirm target performance is met

========================================
5. PRODUCTION TRAINING PIPELINE
[ ] Reproducible training script
[ ] Config-based setup (no hardcoded values)
[ ] Version model weights
[ ] Version dataset
[ ] Save final metrics & plots

========================================
6. INFERENCE & DEPLOYMENT
[ ] Define inference interface
[ ] Implement inference pipeline
[ ] Optimize latency
[ ] Package with Docker
[ ] Expose API or batch interface
[ ] Test on client-like data

========================================
7. VALIDATION & ACCEPTANCE
[ ] Run final evaluation
[ ] Validate against agreed metrics
[ ] Client acceptance test
[ ] Fix last issues if needed

========================================
8. DELIVERY & HANDOVER
[ ] Model weights delivered
[ ] Inference code delivered
[ ] README written (setup, usage, limitations)
[ ] Example inputs + outputs provided
[ ] Retraining strategy explained

========================================
9. OPTIONAL EXTRAS
[ ] Simple UI (React / dashboard)
[ ] Monitoring & logging
[ ] Model update plan
[ ] Maintenance contract proposed

========================================
